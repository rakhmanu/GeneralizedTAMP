## Generalized Task and Motion Planning

This work primarily addresses the problem of how to integrate geometric properties that arise in task-and-motion planning into generalized planning framework.

The objective is to build a "Generalized Task and Motion Planner" which, given a number of TAMP problem instances, can find common structure in those problem instances and build a (possibly probabilistic) program to represent a policy for solving similar problems. 

Such a generalized plan will include the following control flow structures
- Branching
- Looping
- Nested Looping
- And possibly more advanced algorithmic absractions such as map, sort, filter, max/min, etc

Tasks to solve
- TBD

Currently the task planning component of this project is heavily inspired by Siddarth Srivastava's thesis work:
